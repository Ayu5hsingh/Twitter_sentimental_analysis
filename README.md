Sentimental analysis using RoBERTa
RoBERTa stands for Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training Approach. It was presented by researchers at Facebook and Washington University.
The goal of this paper was to optimize the training of BERT architecture in order to take lesser time during pre-training.

Steps to run the code
1) run tweety.py 
2) Give the hashtag
3) Give the date from where you want the tweeet
4) Your tweets will be scraped and downloaded in the same directory
